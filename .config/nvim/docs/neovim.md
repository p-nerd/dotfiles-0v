## Vim Motion

- fundamental motions
    - `j` -> move down
    - `k` -> move up
    - `h` -> move left
    - `l` -> move right
    - `w` -> move right by word
    - `b` -> move left by word
- argument with count motions
    - `[count][j|k|h|l|w|b]` -> repeats the motion `[count]` times
        - examples: 5j moves down 5 lines, 3w moves forward 3 words etc

## Normal Mode

- horizontal motions
    - `_` -> move to first non-blank character of the line
    - `$` -> move to end of the line
    - `0` -> move to first character of the line (column 0)
    - `f<char>` -> move forward to (and land on) the next occurrence of `<char>`
    - `F<char>` -> move backward to (and land on) the previous occurrence of `<char>`
    - `t<char>` -> move forward to (and land before) the next occurrence of `<char>`
    - `T<char>` -> move backward to (and land after) the previous occurrence of `<char>`
    - `;` -> repeat the last `f`, `F`, `t`, or `T` motion forward
    - `,` -> repeat the last `f`, `F`, `t`, or `T` motion backward
- motion with count
    - `8j` -> move down 8 lines
    - `6k` -> move up 6 lines
    - `9h` -> move left 9 characters
    - `10l` -> move right 10 characters

    - `dd` -> delete current line
    - `D` -> delete end of line character to current character
    - `dj`, `d3j`, `dk`, `d3k`, `dw`, `d2w`, `db` & `d3b` -> delete with motions
    - `d$` -> delete from current character to end of the line
- undo/redo
    - `u` -> Undo the previous action
    - `^r` -> Redo the previous action

    - `i` -> enter insert mode before the cursor

    - `y` -> copy (yank) the selected text
    - `yy` -> Copy (yank) the whole current line
    - `d` -> delete the selected text (also copies it)
